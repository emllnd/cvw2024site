## Introduction to Unity for VR

### XR Origin

<VideoEmbed youtube="6kqP7TN5SJs"></VideoEmbed>

In the newest XR Interaction Toolkit, the XR Rig is called XR Origin. Please, also see the manual on [Configuring your Unity Project for XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/configuring-project-for-xr.html). Use the XR Interaction Toolkit version specified on the [Blessed Versions page](/additional/blessedversions) and install the Starter Asset as well.

To save some time, we will later use the XR Interaction Setup prefab in the Starter Asset.

 

### Setup Oculus Link (optional)

This is optional as it needs high tech-specs and a Windows machine. You can find the instructions here: [Set up Meta Quest Link](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/#oculus-link).

 

## Virtual Hello World

Now, we are ready to create our first hello world VR scene.
