## Interactions and locomotion teaser

Unity has published a comprehensive set of interaction examples. We have prepared a [pre-build .apk file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/msn4056aysk9v6f/xri-examples.apk?dl=1) of the project. Download it and check out the different stations and locomotion options in there and play with them.

If you want to look under the hood, the Unity files can be downloaded on the [XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples repo on GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples) (press "Code" and "Download ZIP", unzip, then in Unity Hub "Add" and select the folder).
