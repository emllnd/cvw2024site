## "Blessed Versions" of software, SDKs and packages used on the course in 2024

This is the official supported software environment of the course.

Some older tutorials might show things in a different version or you may already have some other version on your machine. When troubleshooting and asking for help, please consider whether your issue could be due to not using the official versions.

&nbsp;

### Unity Hub & Editor

**Unity Editor: 2022.3.42f (LTS)**

Unity Hub: 3.8.0 or newer

Unity Hub makes it easy to have multiple simultaneous installs of Unity on a single computer at the same time. Unity Hub is the recommended way to install Unity Editor. To get the blessed editor version, first install Unity Hub [from here](https://unity.com/download), then find the correct version on the [Unity Download Archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) and click on "Hub installation".

Each project is tied to a specific Unity version. Unity projects can usually be opened in a newer (but not older) version of Unity, but when opening Unity will perform a one-time one-way version update on the project.
