# Other XR Content And Resources

&nbsp;

### 180 and 360 -degree videos

Especially the stereo VR180 video format seems to be on the rise. Apple Immersive Video is basically this. Some of those clips look really amazing with proper resolution (4k, 6k, 8k or even more).

Download the [DeoVR video player](https://www.meta.com/fi-fi/experiences/2382576078453818/) and explore some VR video footage. There are lots of interesting videos uploaded (music, documentary, sports, travel, ...) in very high quality. Notice! Unfortunately there's also lots of clickbaity, barely Safe For Work (SFW) "VR Girlfriend" -style videos so it can be hard to find some of the cool content.

Can also use the [Meta Quest TV](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/1931356740318898/) to find similar content to watch: concerts, travel. Some very nice content but the app's discovery mechanisms seem a bit poor.
