## Unity Atoms

[Unity Atoms](https://unity-atoms.github.io/unity-atoms/) is an open source library that aims to make your game code:

* 📦 Modular - avoid scripts and systems directly dependent on each other
* ✏️ Editable - Scriptable Objects makes it possible to make changes to your game at runtime
* 🐛 Debuggable - modular code is easier to debug than tightly coupled code

This package is for more advanced usage, where you’d like to build a more complex game logic.

 

Please follow [the guide](https://unity-atoms.github.io/unity-atoms/introduction/installation) on how to install the package.

The [tutorials](https://unity-atoms.github.io/unity-atoms/tutorials/creating-atoms) are very helpful to get an introduction.
