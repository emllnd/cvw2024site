## Unity Atoms

[Unity Atoms](https://unity-atoms.github.io/unity-atoms/) is an open source library that aims to make your game code:

- 📦 Modular - avoid scripts and systems directly dependent on each other
- ✏️ Editable - Scriptable Objects makes it possible to make changes to your game at runtime
- 🐛 Debuggable - modular code is easier to debug than tightly coupled code

This package is for more advanced usage, where you’d like to build a more complex game logic.

&nbsp;

Please follow [the guide](https://unity-atoms.github.io/unity-atoms/introduction/installation) on how to install the package.
