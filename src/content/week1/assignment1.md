## Goal

Get familiar with the Meta Quest app ecosystem and various types of Extended Reality experiences available. Explore different categories like games, productivity tools, social apps, and creative software to understand the offerings. Many experiences are multiplayer so testing together with coursemates is encouraged.

Here are a few prominent websites for finding apps that can be installed directly through the store:

[The official Meta Horizon Store (formerly Quest Store)](https://www.meta.com/fi-fi/experiences/)

[App Lab Game List: Free](https://applabgamelist.com/Free/)

[SideQuest store (Free apps)](https://sidequestvr.com/category/all?sortOn=downloads\&app_license=FREE\&app_platform=1\&app_download_method=1,2) (on app page use "Go To Meta" or "Download Options")

 

### Notes

In SideQuest store you may see references to "sideloading" -- for the purposes of Week1 this is not necessary.

Essentially, any Quest-compatible application packaged as an .apk file can be installed on the headset through developer tools or utilities such as SideQuest, this is called "sideloading". Good to be aware of. We will install our own in-development .apk apps later in the course, either through Unity or manually.

This week you can do all installations through the apps' Store pages, either via the mobile app or via the in-headset store.

Currently there's still a lot of webpages referring to App Lab, Meta's earlier channel for officially distributing apps that are not yet quite ready for their "real app store". As of late August 2024 they are just finishing the process of migrating all these apps to a common store, now called Meta Horizon Store. See here for more:
