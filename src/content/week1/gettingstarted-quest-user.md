## Setup Quest

Create a [Meta Account](https://www.meta.com/login/). This only requires an email address. You do not need it to be connected to any Facebook account or credit card. Later, it will be converted to a Meta Developer account which will require a phone number for 2 Factor Authentication.

Install the [Meta Horizon mobile app](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/getting-started/getting-started-with-quest-2/install-meta-horizon-mobile-app/) on your phone and sign in with your Meta account. We provide you with Quests that are already in the factory reset state, which need to be setup by pairing with a mobile app.

Next week we will be setting up developer-centric account features and software for your computer and the Quest.

For now you can move on to [Explore Quest](/week1/assignment1/)!
