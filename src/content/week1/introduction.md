# Overview

 

## Why study this course?

You may have seen various fun, useful and/or bizarre applications of Extended Reality (XR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and wished you could work on something like that. This course offers hands-on experience with Quest, Unity and C# and teaches practical skills through setting up various small but fundamental pieces of immersive & interactive VR experiences from scratch.

 

## Learning To Code for Non-Coder

Learning to code XR apps can be daunting, especially if you are not from a computer science background. Here is an excellent interview on the path to learning coding with a designer’s mindset.

## Required Hardware

Parts of this course can be completed without a Head Mounted Display (HMD, VR headset). However, for the full experience of these tutorials, you require a headset. Although, recent VR frameworks allow more cross-platform development, it is highly recommended to use an Oculus Quest device.

 

## Headsets & computers

It is possible to complete this course with a windows or a mac. However, windows machine have in general much better support for VR development and are often better equipped in terms of graphics cards.

 

### Virtual & Extended Reality Headsets

We use Quest 2 & 3. They offer one of the best balances of advanced features, ease of use and affordable prices on the market in late 2024.
