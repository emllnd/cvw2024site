Using the Meta Quest Developer Hub (MQDH) to install .apk app packages to the Quest headset.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [MQDH installed and the Quest connection ready](/week2/gettingstarted-quest-developer/)

## Install apps from .apk

When you have MQDH running and the Quest connected with a cable and USB setup recognized OK, you can start the installation by just dragging and dropping the .apk file from Finder(mac)/Explorer(windows) to the Apps section of the Device Manager with MQDH.
